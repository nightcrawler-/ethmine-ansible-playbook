A few things on using geth for CPU mining. 

# start mining, with your wallet address
geth --datadir "/datadrive" --miner.etherbase '0x9e27D5996f7417581886CbA9dd6C70643C8d7742' --mine 2>> geth.log

# start with this to use a specific directory
geth --datadir "/datadrive"

# To run in bg:
TL;DR
Ctrz+Z - To pause
run bg - to send to bg
run disown - to keep running when console is closed

ansible-playbook -i inventory --private-key /home/frederick/Dev/cafrecode/ssh/azure.pem geth.yml  


# mount disk, azure
find it:
lsblk -o NAME,HCTL,SIZE,MOUNTPOINT | grep -i "sd"

partition it:
sudo parted /dev/sdb --script mklabel gpt mkpart xfspart xfs 0% 100%
sudo mkfs.xfs /dev/sdb1
